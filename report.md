# SkilStak Pro Final Report - Winter 2016

countries.skilstak.io

Our project was a webpage that, when you select a country, would give you some information and also give you the ability to select a second one and compare the two with a plus sign next to the larger value for the two countries. I mainly worked on the frontend and adding to the database along 

## Lessons Learned

I had some trouble with the placement of everything on the page using CSS so maybe I should learn it some more as I have litmited experience in it. We had some trouble with. We had some trouble getting the plus signs to work because it would either set to the lower number or would add multiple to the end.

## Next Steps

Our next goal is to be able to add a search bar for all list items and making it harder for people to be able to edit the list because it is not hidden well on our editing page.
